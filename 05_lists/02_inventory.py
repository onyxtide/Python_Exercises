#Learning basic built-in functions for lists in Python

#Exercise: Suppose the holidays are around the corner, and the North Pole elves need your help to have thousands of LEGO toys packed up and ready for shipping.
#Can you figure out the following information using built-in list functions?
#Which LEGO part are the elves running low on?
#Is there a LEGO part that the elves are overstocking?
